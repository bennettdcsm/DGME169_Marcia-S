        <h2>About Me</h2>
        <p>Marcia Sotil is an Interdisciplinary Artist based in the Bay Area pursuing her Bachelor's Degree in Fine Arts in Digital Media Art at San Jose State University. At a young age, she was fascinated by all kinds of art, especially painting, and drawing. As a young adult, her artistic path embraced Modern Dance, Acting, Photography, Voice Acting, Trapeze, Aerial Silks, and Stilt Walking. In the early 2010s, Marcia's emerging passion for the fusion of new technology and Art encouraged her to explore Digital Art.</p>
         <p>As an undergraduate student at San Jose State University, she has been fascinated by Art History, especially French Impressionism, Surrealism. At the same time, she is exposed to New Media, where she creates innovative artworks and dynamic narratives infused with her witty and deep insights. New Media Video Performance Artists such as Hsin-Chien Huang, and Bill Viola are an inspiration in Marcia's individual reflections on humane nature, culture, spirituality, world history, and climate change that have shaped the Anthropocene period.</p>
         <p>Some of her works, mainly Spatial and 2D artworks, depict a sharp cultural criticism, inviting the audience to reflect and empower them as game changers.</p>
